# Telegram Discourse as a Proxy for War-Related Event Detection in Israel

## Overview

This project investigates the potential of Telegram channels as open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools for detecting and analyzing war-related events in Israel. We focus on three major public Telegram channels:

- **Abu Ali Express** (Hebrew-language news)
- **Al Jazeera Arabic** (regional coverage)
- **Pikud HaOref (Home Front Command)** (civil defense alerts)

Using multilingual natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and geospatial visualization, we demonstrate that message activity and content trends from these channels closely align with real-world conflict events.

## Features

- üìÖ **Temporal Analysis**  
  Detects spikes in message volume to identify key conflict dates from 2017 to 2025.

- üó£Ô∏è **Multilingual Topic Modeling**  
  Uses Meta AI's NLLB and Helsinki-NLP models for translation, and KeyBERT for topic extraction and clustering in Hebrew and Arabic.

- üåç **Geopolitical Sentiment Mapping**  
  Applies Named Entity Recognition (NER) and sentiment classification (HeBERT) to analyze emotional tone and international co-mentions.

- üìç **Rocket Alert Dashboard**  
  Extracts Red Alert data from Pikud HaOref and maps intensity and locations using a Folium-based interactive dashboard.
